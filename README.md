# Mediated Expression Score Regression (MESC)

MESC is a tool for estimating heritability mediated by assayed gene expression levels. See preprint here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/730549v1

Code is adapted from LD score regression (Bulik-Sullivan, Finucane; https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). It is still in preliminary form and will be updated in the future. Documentation will be added in the future.
